### what I learned 
1. this is basically the scanf/printf function in c++
2. companies prefer you using std instead cheating with the headspace thing.
3. `endl;` isn't necessary and is there if you need a `\n`
4. when using a void function, you don't need to use `return 0;` because because void functions do not return a value, so there is nothing to return.
5. std:: means you’re using something from the C++ Standard Library’s std namespace. “look inside the std box from the C++ Standard Library to find this thing.”
